; Lab number: 3
; Brief description of the program
;   If the switch is presses, the LED toggles at 8 Hz
; Hardware connections
;  PE0 is switch input  (1 means pressed, 0 means not pressed)
;  PE1 is LED output (1 activates external LED on protoboard) 
;Overall functionality of this system is the similar to Lab 2, with five changes:
;1-  the pin to which we connect the switch is moved to PE0, 
;2-  you will have to remove the PUR initialization because pull up is no longer needed. 
;3-  the pin to which we connect the LED is moved to PE1, 
;4-  the switch is changed from negative to positive logic, and 
;5-  you should increase the delay so it flashes about 8 Hz.
; Operation
;	1) Make PE1 an output and make PE0 an input. 
;	2) The system starts with the LED on (make PE1 =1). 
;   3) Wait about 62 ms
;   4) If the switch is pressed (PE0 is 1), then toggle the LED once, else turn the LED on. 
;   5) Steps 3 and 4 are repeated over and over
